=======================

Magento graphical representation of a Product sold in a Period


This Module gives you a graphical representation of a single product sold over a period on your magento store.
This module is very much similar to the graph shown on the magento admin dashboard except it concentrates on a SINGLE PRODUCT.

This Module will only represent the QUANTITY of a PRODUCT (No revenue included;will be added soon) SOLD  .

Though it uses a simple Javascript and Ajax, no external jQuery apis are used, so there shouldn't be any jQuery conflicts.
